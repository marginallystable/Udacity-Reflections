When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaboratively working with other people.  When working across multiple machines in multiple locations.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than have Git automatically stay up to date with the remote repository?

The possibility of conflicts exists with other users changes with working collaboratively; the manual pull allows you to choose when to work in their changes as oppose to having to stop and resolve conflicts after every auto sync.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is for copying someone else's repo on GitHub to your repo on GitHub.  Clones are for any other copy op, either locally or from GH to local. Branch is for creating various changes within the same code.  Use forks for making your own version of someone else's code.  Clones for copying from GH.  Branches for changes within a repo.
