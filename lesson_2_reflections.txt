What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An empty repository is created.  This sets stuff up for your first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offsets?

The staging area is an intermediate transition zone that allows the user to isolate and group changes from the working directory prior to committing them.
